#Quiz plugin

This project is a quiz plugin fully developed in jQuery. It allows you to easily integrate mutliple choice questions in a web page in order to test the user. At the end he or she will get his/her result.

I developed this little plugin during my work time as a trainner at the Simplon Roubaix school. We have several ressurces to train people to web development and this plugin is a great way for us to create little tests so that our student can check if they know enough or not about technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS or PHP.

You can see some live exemple of this plugin at those adresses but everything is written in french :
